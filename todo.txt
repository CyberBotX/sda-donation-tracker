Features:
- Better error dialogs:
  - make them seem less like raw dumps of json objects

- Prize drawing task:
  - list all undrawn prizes whose time (or games' time) has passed

- Pinned objects task:
  - list all bids for games/prizes that are upcomming
  - list all bids of games/prizes that are pinned that have passed

Bugs:

- When closing a 'fresh' tab, it still indicates that there are unsaved changes on the tab
  - Probably a 'null' vs 'blank' thing in most cases

- When you add a new choice, it takes too long for the option to show up
  - And when you search it, it gives a 'value error' error when you try to save with the result
    - Only if the value is _not_ in the bimap though
    
- The tab orders on the donation tasks tabs are all out of wack, fix them to make sense
